# Hometask #2

Continue working on application that was created in [Hometask #1](https://github.com/dnbard/react-tutorial/blob/master/hometask_1.md)

* Add routing to the existing application
  * In example: url `http://localhost:9000/persons/5` should open Persons component with id=5 (<Persons pid=5 />)
  * `Previous` and `Next` buttons should use routing
  * hash history could be used
* All components should be tested with help of [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)
